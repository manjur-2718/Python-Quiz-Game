# Python-Quiz-Game

This project is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) based quiz game developed using Python's Tkinter library. It is designed to test a userâ€™s basic understanding of Python programming through a series of multiple-choice questions. The game presents one question at a time, each with four options, and the user is required to select the correct answer within a 30-second countdown timer.

The game includes features such as:

-> Real-time countdown timer for each question

-> Score tracking

-> Randomized questions on every quiz attempt

-> Restart functionality after the quiz ends

-> Graphical interface (radio buttons, buttons, and labels) for smooth interaction
